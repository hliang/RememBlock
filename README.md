# RememBlock - a memory game

Click each block only once, don't click a block more than one time.<br>
Every time a block is clicked, the blocks shuffle in a random order.<br>
You get one point every time you click.<br>
Game over if there is an incorrect guess. A new game will start.<br>

So try to remember what have been clicked, and have fun!
